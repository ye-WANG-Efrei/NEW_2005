  Release v3 is currently in beta. This documentation reflects the features and
  functionality in progress and may change before the final release.
</Note>

You can train PandaAI to understand your data better and to improve its performance. Training is as easy as calling the `train` method on the `Agent`.

## Prerequisites

Before you start training PandaAI, you need to set your PandaAI API key.
You can generate your API key by signing up at [https://app.pandabi.ai](https://app.pandabi.ai).

```python
import pandasai as pai

pai.api_key.set("your-pai-api-key")
```

It is important that you set the API key, or it will fail with the following error: `No vector store provided. Please provide a vector store to train the agent`.

## Instructions training

Instructions training is used to teach PandaAI how you expect it to respond to certain queries. You can provide generic instructions about how you expect the model to approach certain types of queries, and PandaAI will use these instructions to generate responses to similar queries.

For example, you might want the LLM to be aware that your company's fiscal year starts in April, or about specific ways you want to handle missing data. Or you might want to teach it about specific business rules or data analysis best practices that are specific to your organization.

To train PandaAI with instructions, you can use the `train` method on the `Agent`, as it follows:

The training uses by default the `BambooVectorStore` to store the training data, and it's accessible with the API key.

As an alternative, if you want to use a local vector store (enterprise only for production use cases), you can use the `ChromaDB`, `Qdrant` or `Pinecone` vector stores (see examples below).

```python
import pandasai as pai
from pandasai import Agent

pai.api_key.set("your-pai-api-key")

agent = Agent("data.csv")
agent.train(docs="The fiscal year starts in April")

response = agent.chat("What is the total sales for the fiscal year?")
print(response)
# The model will use the information provided in the training to generate a response
```

Your training data is persisted, so you only need to train the model once.

## Q/A training

Q/A training is used to teach PandaAI the desired process to answer specific questions, enhancing the model's performance and determinism. One of the biggest challenges with LLMs is that they are not deterministic, meaning that the same question can produce different answers at different times. Q/A training can help to mitigate this issue.

To train PandaAI with Q/A, you can use the `train` method on the `Agent`, as it follows:

```python
from pandasai import Agent

agent = Agent("data.csv")

# Train the model
query = "What is the total sales for the current fiscal year?"
# The following code is passed as a string to the response variable
response = '\n'.join([
    'import pandas as pd',
    '',
    'df = dfs[0]',
    '',
    '# Calculate the total sales for the current fiscal year',
    'total_sales = df[df[\'date\'] >= pd.to_datetime(\'today\').replace(month=4, day=1)][\'sales\'].sum()',
    'result = { "type": "number", "value": total_sales }'
])

agent.train(queries=[query], codes=[response])

response = agent.chat("What is the total sales for the last fiscal year?")
print(response)

# The model will use the information provided in the training to generate a response
```

Also in this case, your training data is persisted, so you only need to train the model once.

## Training with local Vector stores

If you want to train the model with a local vector store, you can use the local `ChromaDB`, `Qdrant` or `Pinecone` vector stores. Here's how to do it:
An enterprise license is required for using the vector stores locally, ([check it out](https://github.com/Sinaptik-AI/pandas-ai/blob/master/pandasai/ee/LICENSE)).
If you plan to use it in production, [contact us](https://pandas-ai.com/pricing).

```python
from pandasai import Agent
from pandasai.ee.vectorstores import ChromaDB
from pandasai.ee.vectorstores import Qdrant
from pandasai.ee.vectorstores import Pinecone
from pandasai.ee.vector_stores import LanceDB

# Instantiate the vector store
vector_store = ChromaDB()
# or with Qdrant
# vector_store = Qdrant()
# or with LanceDB
vector_store = LanceDB()
# or with Pinecone
# vector_store = Pinecone(
#     api_key="*****",
#     embedding_function=embedding_function,
#     dimensions=384, # dimension of your embedding model
# )

# Instantiate the agent with the custom vector store
agent = Agent("data.csv", vectorstore=vector_store)

# Train the model
query = "What is the total sales for the current fiscal year?"
# The following code is passed as a string to the response variable
response = '\n'.join([
    'import pandas as pd',
    '',
    'df = dfs[0]',
    '',
    '# Calculate the total sales for the current fiscal year',
    'total_sales = df[df[\'date\'] >= pd.to_datetime(\'today\').replace(month=4, day=1)][\'sales\'].sum()',
    'result = { "type": "number", "value": total_sales }'
])

agent.train(queries=[query], codes=[response])

response = agent.chat("What is the total sales for the last fiscal year?")
print(response)
# The model will use the information provided in the training to generate a response
```

## Using the Sandbox Environment

To enhance security and protect against malicious code through prompt injection, PandaAI provides a sandbox environment for code execution. The sandbox runs your code in an isolated Docker container, ensuring that potentially harmful operations are contained.

### Installation

Before using the sandbox, you need to install Docker on your machine and ensure it is running.

First, install the sandbox package:

```bash
pip install pandasai-docker
```

### Basic Usage

Here's how to use the sandbox with your PandaAI agent:

```python
from pandasai import Agent
from pandasai_docker import DockerSandbox

# Initialize the sandbox
sandbox = DockerSandbox()
sandbox.start()

# Create an agent with the sandbox
df = pai.read_csv("data.csv")
agent = Agent([df], sandbox=sandbox)

# Chat with the agent - code will run in the sandbox
response = agent.chat("Calculate the average sales")

# Don't forget to stop the sandbox when done
sandbox.stop()
```

### Customizing the Sandbox

You can customize the sandbox environment by specifying a custom name and Dockerfile:

```python
sandbox = DockerSandbox(
    "custom-sandbox-name",
    "/path/to/custom/Dockerfile"
)
```

<Note>
  The sandbox works offline and provides an additional layer of security for
  code execution. It's particularly useful when working with untrusted data or
  when you need to ensure that code execution is isolated from your main system.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

In some cases, you might get an error like this: `No vector store provided. Please provide a vector store to train the agent`. It means no API key has been generated to use the `BambooVectorStore`.

Here's how to fix it:

First of all, you'll need to generated an API key (check the prerequisites paragraph above).
Once you have generated the API key, you have 2 options:

1. Override the env variable (`os.environ["PANDABI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_PANDABI_API_KEY"`)
2. Instantiate the vector store and pass the API key:

```python
# Instantiate the vector store with the API keys
vector_store = BambooVectorStor(api_key="YOUR_PANDABI_API_KEY")

# Instantiate the agent with the custom vector store
agent = Agent(connector, config={...} vectorstore=vector_store)
```

## Custom Head

In some cases, you might want to provide custom data samples to the conversational agent to improve its understanding and responses. For example, you might want to:

- Provide better examples that represent your data patterns
- Avoid sharing sensitive information
- Guide the agent with specific data scenarios

You can do this by passing a custom head to the agent:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandasai as pai

# Your original dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'sensitive_id': [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005],
    'amount': [150, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B']
})

# Create a custom head with anonymized data
head_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'sensitive_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'amount': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B']
})

# Use the custom head
smart_df = pai.SmartDataframe(df, config={
    "custom_head": head_df
})
```

The agent will use your custom head instead of the default first 5 rows of the dataframe when analyzing and responding to queries.

### Using Sandbox

To use the sandbox environment, you first need to install the required package and have Docker running on your system:

```bash
pip install pandasai-docker
```

<Note title="Sandbox Requirements">
  Make sure you have Docker running on your system before using the sandbox
  environment.
</Note>

Here's how to enable the sandbox for your PandaAI agent:

```python
from pandasai import Agent
from pandasai_docker import DockerSandbox

# Initialize and start the sandbox
sandbox = DockerSandbox()
sandbox.start()

# Create an agent with the sandbox enabled
agent = Agent("data.csv", sandbox=sandbox)

# The code will now run in an isolated Docker container
response = agent.chat("What is the total sales for each country?")

# Don't forget to stop the sandbox when done
sandbox.stop()
```

You can also customize the sandbox environment:

```python
# Custom sandbox configuration
sandbox = DockerSandbox(
    "custom-sandbox-name",
    "/path/to/custom/Dockerfile"
)
```
